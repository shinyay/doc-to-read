- [x] [App Modernization: Why ‘Lift and Shift’ Isn’t Good Enough](pdf/2021-12-08-thenewstack.pdf)
  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/app-modernization-why-lift-and-shift-isnt-good-enough/)
  > For instance, less than half of participants in a 2020 survey by Harvard Business Review said their cloud strategy has been effective in terms of IT management, customer experience, and innovation. That failure rate is because many IT organizations just lift and shift — simply re-host to the cloud — to meet artificial deadlines.

  <summary> 7Rs </summary>

  > 1. Retain
  >  - There will be data that can’t be moved, or mainframe modernization that can be postponed.

  > 2. Re-host.
  > - Move the workload from a virtual machine (VM) to a public cloud. In these cases, lift-and-shift is actually the right fit, especially if on-premise has become too costly.

  > 3. Refactor.
  > - Change the application’s code without changing its behavior, so there’s no change in user experience, but speed or efficiency should improve.

  > 4. Re-architect.
  > - Modify the source code, which often means radically changing architecture to microservices. This usually allows it to use the cloud and improve scalability.

  > 5. Rebuild.
  > - Totally rebuild in a cloud native way.

  > 6. Replace.
  > - Move to an off-the-shelf software-as-a-service product (SaaS).

  > 7. Retire.
  > - Deprecate the application.

  > app modernization is a journey, not a destination.


- [x] [When to Choose Cloud Foundry over Kubernetes](pdf/2021-12-02-thenewstack.pdf)
  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/when-to-choose-cloud-foundry-over-kubernetes/)
  > While a single Kubernetes cluster might be easier to operate than a single Cloud Foundry, managing 100 Kubernetes clusters is several orders of magnitude harder than managing a single Cloud Foundry. 

  > Managing a large number of Kubernetes clusters creates complexity that is not necessary with Cloud Foundry.

  >Kubernetes can be customized much more than Cloud Foundry and therefore accept workloads that Cloud Foundry couldn’t.

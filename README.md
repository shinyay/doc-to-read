- [x] [The ever-widening world of Wasm](https://github.com/shinyay/doc-to-read/files/9721083/2022-09-27-infoworld.pdf)
  - [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3674124/the-ever-widening-world-of-wasm.html)
  > The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) first announced Wasm, i.e., WebAssembly, back in 2015 and published it in 2018. Originally designed solely for use in the browser, the in-the-weeds Wasm is garnering interest as a potential barrier breaker across different hardware and software environments. The original vision for Wasm was a security tool that allowed developers to safely use compiled languages like C, C++, or Rust in the browser, while at the same time preventing the code from taking over a user’s machine.
  > Wasm blockers: Perhaps a bigger issue is that Wasm, a very specific instruction set architecture, is not currently POSIX-compliant, so you can’t use it to do a lot of standard things developers have come to expect (think of things like opening a file or a network socket).

  - [thenewstack](https://thenewstack.io/what-is-zero-trust-security/)

  >Zero Trust is built on a couple of principles:
  >  - Always verify access for all users across all devices.
  >  - By minimizing access, the impact of external and internal breaches is also minimized if they do occur.
  >  - Access to resources, systems, software, and applications is determined by the policy and user identification only.
  >  - Implementing contextual analysis and collection can help you see behavior patterns across the network and respond quickly.

  >With zero trust implemented, companies can accomplish the following:
  > - Improve real-time visibility into all their cloud, hybrid, and on-premise environments.
  > - Protect data, applications, devices, and networks from cyberattack infiltration.
  > - Minimize the risk of data and security breaches.
  > - Decrease the time it takes to detect and respond to an attack.
  > - Continuously monitor components, users, workloads, and devices across multiple environments.
  > - Build a consistent user experience for internal and external employees and contractors.

  > - Possible use-cases for SBOMs
  > - Security alerts of dependencies will be the most obvious use-case. If a CVE is detected, you can inspect your SBOM and see if the components you are using are in any way affected
  > - It will be easy to identify when a certain component was created and how. In addition to that, having the licensing information of all the pieces, you better know what you can do with it (redistribute, change, etc)
  > - Automation allows you to send alerts, if a compliance issue is detected, e.g. if the licensing of updated/replaced dependencies changes
  > Missing components or required build files. Incompatible licenses and more

- [x] [The History of Pets vs Cattle and How to Use the Analogy Properly](https://github.com/shinyay/doc-to-read/files/8021890/2016-09-29-blog.pdf)
  - [blog](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle)

  > - “scale-up” vs. “scale-out” architectures
  > - pets vs cattle in the context of cloud, and emphasizing the disposability of cattle and the uniqueness of pets
  > - Pets: Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on.
  > - Cattle: Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master.

- [x] [App Modernization: 5 Tips When Migrating to Kubernetes](https://github.com/shinyay/doc-to-read/files/8000832/2022-01-27-thenewstack.pdf)
  - [thenewstack](https://thenewstack.io/app-modernization-5-tips-when-migrating-to-kubernetes)

  > 1. Treat Your Legacy Apps Like Pets, Not Cattle
  > - Pets are each vitally important, but Cattle are interchangeable.
  > - In the context of a cloud migration, infrastructure managers need to apply this adage in the reverse: Your apps and virtual machines should indeed be treated like pets, not like cattle.

  > 2. Don’t Just Lift and Shift — Evolve Your Approach for a Better App
  > - You could simply translate your legacy apps to a cloud-based environment. But what worked on-premises isn’t going to necessarily work in the cloud.
  > - Decomposing apps: for greater scalability, availability and flexibility
  > - Automated infrastructure: rapid releases and continuous improvement
  > - Leveraging containers rather than VMs: agility and high availablity

  > 3. But If You’re Not Ready to Leave Your VMs Behind, There Are Options
  > - Hosting your VM in the cloud, in their original on-premises format and managed by the same hypervisor, 
  > - can be beneficial if there’s a lot of institutional knowledge at your organization related to their use
  > - you don’t want to give that knowledge up to learn a new system

<summary>TL;DR</summary>

> Today, the idea that “every company needs to become a software company” is considered almost a cliché.

> “Six decades into the computer revolution, four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale.”

> For a traditional industrial or service company, making the transition to acting like a software company is a massive undertaking. You need to hire new people in every part of your organization; restructure around different economics; overhaul infrastructure.

> Focus on your core
> As Steve Jobs once famously said, “Deciding what not to do is just as important as deciding what to do.”
> Uber doesn’t own their cars. They also don’t directly employ their own drivers.
> The core application and ecosystem around the Uber experience is their primary asset and differentiator.

> Focusing on your core when it comes to technology makes it easier to focus on your end-customer experience — and that’s what makes a great software company.

<details>
<summary>TL;DR</summary>

> Companies that understand DevOps tend not to use the term “DevOps” at all, nor do they have any "DevOps engineers”.

> DevOps isn't a role. It's a culture.

> Companies that genuinely understand DevOps understand it's not a siloed team or function, but instead a new way of doing business that brings with it a new culture, new processes, embedded SREs, a hyper-focus on automation across the board, a service-based architecture, specific SLOs and an associated budget.

> DevOps shouldn't be one person's concern. It should be an integrated part of your engineering culture to have the most significant impact.

> DevOps isn't just about the speed and agility of software development and delivery. It's also about good security practices.
As DevOps practices improve, DevSecOps naturally follows.

> It is possible to achieve speed without sacrificing security. It starts by rethinking how security fits into your delivery workflow.

> The more security is woven into the best practices of everyone’s job, the easier it is to maintain your desired deployment velocity as well as ensure solid security practices. DevOps helps achieve the balance.

> I often hear people say they want a product for DevOps. But is it possible to achieve consistent DevOps with just a product?
Software development in organizations consists of a variety of requirements. Therefore, a DevOps approach that is adapted to each company is necessary.

> It is a mistake to think that you can just buy a certain technology and immediately achieve DevOps. DevOps is first and foremost a culture and a way of working. Organizations need to move from a tool-first mindset to a team-first mindset.

  <details>
  <summary>TL;DR</summary>

  > Cloud-native is a modern approach to building and running software applications that exploits the flexibility, scalability, and resilience of cloud computing.

  > The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) defines cloud-native a little more narrowly, focusing on application containerization

  > 1. The application definition and development layer
  > - The top layer of the cloud-native stack focuses on the tools used by developers to build applications

  > 2. The provisioning layer
  > - The provisioning layer of the cloud-native stack includes anything required to build and secure the environment where an application will run, ideally in a repeatable fashion

  > 3. The runtime layer
  > -  The runtime layer concerns anything associated with the running of a cloud-native application

  > 4. The orchestration and management layer
  > - The orchestration and management layer brings together the tools required to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications, including orchestration and scheduling

  > (v.) Observability

  > Key differences between Clound Native apps and traditional apps
  > - Updatability
  > - Elasticity
  > - Mulititenancy
  > - Downtime

  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/app-modernization-why-lift-and-shift-isnt-good-enough/)
  > For instance, less than half of participants in a 2020 survey by Harvard Business Review said their cloud strategy has been effective in terms of IT management, customer experience, and innovation. That failure rate is because many IT organizations just lift and shift — simply re-host to the cloud — to meet artificial deadlines.
  
  <details>
  <summary> 7Rs </summary>

  > 1. Retain
  >  - There will be data that can’t be moved, or mainframe modernization that can be postponed.

  > 2. Re-host.
  > - Move the workload from a virtual machine (VM) to a public cloud. In these cases, lift-and-shift is actually the right fit, especially if on-premise has become too costly.

  > 3. Refactor.
  > - Change the application’s code without changing its behavior, so there’s no change in user experience, but speed or efficiency should improve.

  > 4. Re-architect.
  > - Modify the source code, which often means radically changing architecture to microservices. This usually allows it to use the cloud and improve scalability.

  > 5. Rebuild.
  > - Totally rebuild in a cloud native way.

  > 6. Replace.
  > - Move to an off-the-shelf software-as-a-service product (SaaS).

  > 7. Retire.
  > - Deprecate the application.

  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/when-to-choose-cloud-foundry-over-kubernetes/)
  > While a single Kubernetes cluster might be easier to operate than a single Cloud Foundry, managing 100 Kubernetes clusters is several orders of magnitude harder than managing a single Cloud Foundry. 

  > Managing a large number of Kubernetes clusters creates complexity that is not necessary with Cloud Foundry.

  >Kubernetes can be customized much more than Cloud Foundry and therefore accept workloads that Cloud Foundry couldn’t.

<details>
<summary>TL;DR</summary>

> Cloud Native Application marks a clear jump in the level of complexity of our software.

  > Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said during the AWS Summit in 2019. “Was it easier in the days when everything was in a monolith? Yes, for some parts definitely.”

  > Essential is the complexity in the business domain you are working in, the fact that enterprises are extremely complicated environments, so the problems they are trying to solve are inherently complex. The other area is accidental; this is the complexity that comes with our tooling and what we layer on top when solving a problem.

  > The cloud-native era has ushered in the potential for more accidental complexity than ever before

  > The complexity inherent to a huge catalog of available services can become, in certain settings, less a strength than a liability.

  > The key to a good internal developer platform then is finding that balance between self-service for developers who want to get on with the job at hand and abstracting the tasks that are the least valuable, without making developers feel restricted

  > The idea behind having golden paths is not to limit or stifle engineers, or set standards for the sake of it. With golden paths in place, teams don’t have to reinvent the wheel, have fewer decisions to make, and can use their productivity and creativity for higher objectives. They can get back to moving fast

  > Complexity is less the issue than inconsistency in an environment by Craig McLuckie

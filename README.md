- [x] [App Modernization: Why ‘Lift and Shift’ Isn’t Good Enough](pdf/2021-12-08-thenewstack.pdf)
  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/app-modernization-why-lift-and-shift-isnt-good-enough/)
  > For instance, less than half of participants in a 2020 survey by Harvard Business Review said their cloud strategy has been effective in terms of IT management, customer experience, and innovation. That failure rate is because many IT organizations just lift and shift — simply re-host to the cloud — to meet artificial deadlines.

  <summary> 7Rs </summary>

  > 1. Retain
  >  - There will be data that can’t be moved, or mainframe modernization that can be postponed.

  > 2. Re-host.
  > - Move the workload from a virtual machine (VM) to a public cloud. In these cases, lift-and-shift is actually the right fit, especially if on-premise has become too costly.

  > 3. Refactor.
  > - Change the application’s code without changing its behavior, so there’s no change in user experience, but speed or efficiency should improve.

  > 4. Re-architect.
  > - Modify the source code, which often means radically changing architecture to microservices. This usually allows it to use the cloud and improve scalability.

  > 5. Rebuild.
  > - Totally rebuild in a cloud native way.

  > 6. Replace.
  > - Move to an off-the-shelf software-as-a-service product (SaaS).

  > 7. Retire.
  > - Deprecate the application.

  > app modernization is a journey, not a destination.


- [x] [When to Choose Cloud Foundry over Kubernetes](pdf/2021-12-02-thenewstack.pdf)
  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/when-to-choose-cloud-foundry-over-kubernetes/)
  > While a single Kubernetes cluster might be easier to operate than a single Cloud Foundry, managing 100 Kubernetes clusters is several orders of magnitude harder than managing a single Cloud Foundry. 

  > Managing a large number of Kubernetes clusters creates complexity that is not necessary with Cloud Foundry.

  >Kubernetes can be customized much more than Cloud Foundry and therefore accept workloads that Cloud Foundry couldn’t.

- [x] [Complexity is killing software developers](pdf/2021-11-01-infoworld.pdf)
  - [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html)
  > Cloud Native Application marks a clear jump in the level of complexity of our software.

  > Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said during the AWS Summit in 2019. “Was it easier in the days when everything was in a monolith? Yes, for some parts definitely.”

  > Essential is the complexity in the business domain you are working in, the fact that enterprises are extremely complicated environments, so the problems they are trying to solve are inherently complex. The other area is accidental; this is the complexity that comes with our tooling and what we layer on top when solving a problem.

  > The cloud-native era has ushered in the potential for more accidental complexity than ever before

  > The complexity inherent to a huge catalog of available services can become, in certain settings, less a strength than a liability.

  > The key to a good internal developer platform then is finding that balance between self-service for developers who want to get on with the job at hand and abstracting the tasks that are the least valuable, without making developers feel restricted

  > The idea behind having golden paths is not to limit or stifle engineers, or set standards for the sake of it. With golden paths in place, teams don’t have to reinvent the wheel, have fewer decisions to make, and can use their productivity and creativity for higher objectives. They can get back to moving fast

  > Complexity is less the issue than inconsistency in an environment by Craig McLuckie

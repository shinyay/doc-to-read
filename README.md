- [x] [When to Choose Cloud Foundry over Kubernetes](pdf/2021-12-02-thenewstack.pdf)
  - [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/when-to-choose-cloud-foundry-over-kubernetes/)
  > While a single Kubernetes cluster might be easier to operate than a single Cloud Foundry, managing 100 Kubernetes clusters is several orders of magnitude harder than managing a single Cloud Foundry. 

  > Managing a large number of Kubernetes clusters creates complexity that is not necessary with Cloud Foundry.

  >Kubernetes can be customized much more than Cloud Foundry and therefore accept workloads that Cloud Foundry couldnâ€™t.
